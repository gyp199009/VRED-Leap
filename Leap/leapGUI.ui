        Sample Leap Motion VRED integration

        This integration is not feature complete, and should be used as an example of how such an implementation could look like.


        This plugin will apply transformations to hand bone nodes in the scenegraph.
        See the Leap Motion documentation or Hands.osb form the Plugin folder for more information.
        If no hands are present in the scene, example hands will be loaded on first start.

        See Leap.py in the "ScriptPlugins" folder for implementation details.
